# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability in any Answer Digital repository, please use GitHubâ€™s Security Advisory tool to report it. You can access this from the **Security** tab in the repository and clicking **Report a vulnerability.**

If reporting is not available for this repository, the issue can be [reported to the default security advisory](https://github.com/answerdigital/.github/security) for the organisation.
